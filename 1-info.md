				<p>
				This isn't the first year we've competed in TeenTech - it's our second!<br><br>
As a part of an extra-curricular activity, we found the idea of using a Raspberry Pi as a computer for developing countries and decided to develop it further for our entry into TeenTech.<br>
What surprised us is that we got into the finals! We brought with us an 'embryo' of today's Solar Pi, with only the core components and no case. Unfortunately, we did not win in our category, as we didn’t have a design for the final product.<br>
<br>
Our old Solar Pi also had a number of issues:<br>
• The touchscreen was too small<br>
• The single solar panel wasn't powerful enough<br>
• It used an older Raspberry Pi, meaning that it had poor performance<br>
