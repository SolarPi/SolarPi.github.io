# Hello!

We're a team of 3 students from the UK who've participated in TeenTech, with our project, the Solar Pi. 

If you'd like say hello, pop us an email or take a look at our Instagram - both are linked at the bottom of this page.

# Acknowledgements

You've might have read some of this before, but we really mean it, so we've put it here again.

We’d like to say a huge **thank you** to those who have supported our project, from staff at our school to people who we’ve got in touch with. We’d also like to thank TeenTech for providing us with such an amazing opportunity - it’s been fantastic, fascinating journey we’ve had with the Solar Pi.

Happy 10th birthday, TeenTech!
